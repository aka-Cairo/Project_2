# Credit Card Eligibility Dataset Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze and make predictions based on the **Credit Card Eligibility Dataset: Determining Factors**. The dataset is a comprehensive collection of variables aimed at understanding the factors that influence an individual's eligibility for a credit card. 

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes a wide range of demographic, financial, and personal attributes that are commonly considered by financial institutions when assessing an individual's suitability for credit. Each row represents a unique individual, identified by a unique ID, with associated attributes.

### Key Features

- **Demographic Information**
  - Gender
  - Age

- **Financial Indicators**
  - Total Income
  - Employment Status

- **Personal Attributes**
  - Familial Status
  - Housing
  - Education
  - Occupation

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are to:
1. **Understand** the key factors that influence credit card eligibility.
2. **Analyze** the dataset to extract meaningful insights.
3. **Build Predictive Models** to determine the likelihood of an individual's eligibility for a credit card.

## Methodology

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**
   - Load and inspect the dataset.
   - Handle missing values and outliers.
   - Encode categorical variables.
   - Normalize/standardize numerical features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize the distribution of key features.
   - Identify correlations between variables.
   - Detect patterns and trends in the data.

3. **Model Building**
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Train various machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, etc.).
   - Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

4. **Model Selection and Optimization**
   - Compare model performances.
   - Tune hyperparameters for the best model.
   - Validate the model on the testing set.
